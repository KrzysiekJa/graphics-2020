Repo includes programs created during the semester devoted computer graphics. Here are two catalogs:
```
- one with python programs made with use of PyQt5,
- second with programs that work with use of OpenGL libraries.
```
In OpenGL catalog there are missing folders with element of SFML v. 2.5.1 and GLM libraries, that also with others are needed to be added with graphics files.
